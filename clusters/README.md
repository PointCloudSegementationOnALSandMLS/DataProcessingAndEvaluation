## Clusters

To cluster the vertical points inside the prediction we implemented the calculate_clusters.py script. The results of these scripts are the .npy files. Here instead of the semantic label, the points were assigned to a specific cluster. Further, in the .json files for each cluster the calculated height is stored.
